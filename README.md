# Circuit Theory & Robotics Course

A comprehensive static website providing detailed lessons on circuit theory, electronics, and robotics.

## Overview

This course is designed to take students from the basics of number systems all the way to building and programming their own robot. Each lesson builds upon the previous one, providing a solid foundation in electronics, circuits, and robotics.

## Course Curriculum

1. **Number Systems**: Introduction to binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems used in computing and electronics.
2. **Binary Arithmetic**: Learn to perform addition, subtraction, and other operations in binary.
3. **Logic Gates**: Understand the basic building blocks of digital circuits: AND, OR, NOT, and more.
4. **Circuit Components**: Explore resistors, capacitors, transistors, and other fundamental components.
5. **Breadboard Basics**: Learn how to use breadboards for circuit prototyping.
6. **LEDs & Digital Outputs**: Control LEDs and understand digital outputs in circuits.
7. **Buttons & Switches**: Implement user input through buttons and various switches.
8. **Sensors & Serial Communication**: Use sensors to gather data and transmit it through serial communication.
9. **Motor Control**: Learn to control DC motors, servo motors, and stepper motors.
10. **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Implement distance measurement using ultrasonic sensors.
11. **Combining Sensors & Motors**: Create reactive systems by integrating sensors with motor control.
12. **Assembling the Robot**: Put together all components to build your robot's physical structure.
13. **Writing the Code**: Program your robot to perform tasks and respond to its environment.
14. **Testing & Debugging**: Test your robot and learn how to identify and fix issues.
15. **Enhancements & Creativity**: Take your robot to the next level with advanced features and creative additions.
