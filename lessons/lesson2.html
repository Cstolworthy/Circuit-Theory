            <section>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In the previous lesson, we learned about different number systems, with a focus on binary representation. Now, we'll explore how to perform arithmetic operations in binary, which is essential for understanding how computers and digital circuits process data.</p>
                <p>Binary arithmetic forms the foundation of all calculations performed by digital systems, from simple calculators to complex robotics controllers.</p>

                <h3>Binary Addition</h3>
                <p>Binary addition follows rules similar to decimal addition, but with only two digits (0 and 1):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>0 + 0 = 0</li>
                    <li>0 + 1 = 1</li>
                    <li>1 + 0 = 1</li>
                    <li>1 + 1 = 10 (which is 2 in decimal, written as 0 with a carry of 1)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Example: Adding 1011 and 101</h4>
                <div class="code-block">
                     1 1 1    (carries)
                     1 0 1 1  (first number)
                   +   1 0 1  (second number)
                   ---------
                     1 0 0 0 0  (result)
                </div>
                <p>Let's break down this calculation step by step:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Last column: 1 + 1 = 10, write 0 and carry 1</li>
                    <li>Second column from right: 1 (carry) + 1 + 0 = 10, write 0 and carry 1</li>
                    <li>Third column from right: 1 (carry) + 0 + 1 = 10, write 0 and carry 1</li>
                    <li>Fourth column from right: 1 (carry) + 1 + 0 = 10, write 0 and carry 1</li>
                    <li>The final carry becomes the leftmost digit: 1</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Therefore, 1011 + 101 = 10000 (which is 11 + 5 = 16 in decimal).</p>
                
                <div class="note-box">
                    <strong>Note:</strong> In digital circuits, binary addition is performed by components called "adders." A half-adder can add two bits, while a full-adder can add three bits (including a carry).

                <h3>Binary Subtraction</h3>
                <p>Binary subtraction can be approached in several ways, but the most common methods are:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Direct Subtraction</h4>
                <p>Rules for direct subtraction:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>0 - 0 = 0</li>
                    <li>1 - 0 = 1</li>
                    <li>1 - 1 = 0</li>
                    <li>0 - 1 = 1 with a borrow of 1 from the next column</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Example: Subtracting 101 from 1011</h4>
                <div class="code-block">
                     1 0 1 1  (first number)
                   -   1 0 1  (second number)
                   ---------
                       1 1 0  (result)
                </div>
                <p>Breaking it down:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Last column: 1 - 1 = 0</li>
                    <li>Second column from right: 1 - 0 = 1</li>
                    <li>Third column from right: 0 - 1 = 1 with a borrow, so effectively (1)0 - 1 = 1</li>
                    <li>Fourth column from right: 1 - 0 - 1 (the borrow) = 0</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Therefore, 1011 - 101 = 110 (which is 11 - 5 = 6 in decimal).</p>
                
                <h4>2. Two's Complement Method</h4>
                <p>In digital systems, subtraction is often performed using the two's complement method, which allows us to subtract by adding the two's complement of the subtrahend.</p>
                <p>To find the two's complement of a binary number:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Flip all the bits (1s become 0s, and 0s become 1s) - this is called the one's complement</li>
                    <li>Add 1 to the result</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Example: Subtract 101 from 1011 using two's complement</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    Find two's complement of 101:
                    - One's complement: 010
                    - Add 1: 010 + 1 = 011
                    
                    Now add 1011 + 011:
                      1 0 1 1
                    +     0 1 1
                    ---------
                      1 1 1 0
                </div>
                <p>Since we're working with 4-bit numbers and the result has 5 bits, we ignore the carry and take only the 4 rightmost bits, which gives us 110.</p>
                <p>Therefore, 1011 - 101 = 110 (which is 11 - 5 = 6 in decimal), matching our previous calculation.</p>

                <h3>Binary Multiplication</h3>
                <p>Binary multiplication follows these simple rules:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>0 × 0 = 0</li>
                    <li>0 × 1 = 0</li>
                    <li>1 × 0 = 0</li>
                    <li>1 × 1 = 1</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The process is similar to decimal multiplication, but simpler because we only multiply by 0 or 1.</p>
                
                <h4>Example: Multiplying 101 by 11</h4>
                <div class="code-block">
                        1 0 1  (first number)
                      ×   1 1  (second number)
                    -------
                        1 0 1  (101 × 1)
                    + 1 0 1    (101 × 1, shifted one position left)
                    ---------
                      1 1 1 1  (result)
                </div>
                <p>Therefore, 101 × 11 = 1111 (which is 5 × 3 = 15 in decimal).</p>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Binary Division</h3>
                <p>Binary division follows the same principle as decimal long division, but with only binary digits.</p>
                
                <h4>Example: Dividing 1100 by 11</h4>
                <div class="code-block">
                          1 0 0  (quotient)
                       -------
                    1 1 ) 1 1 0 0
                          1 1    
                         ----
                           0 0
                           0 0
                          ----
                             0  (remainder)
                </div>
                <p>Therefore, 1100 ÷ 11 = 100 with a remainder of 0 (which is 12 ÷ 3 = 4 with a remainder of 0 in decimal).</p>

                <h3>Bitwise Operations</h3>
                <p>In addition to arithmetic operations, digital systems frequently use bitwise operations, which operate on individual bits:</p>
                
                <h4>1. Bitwise AND (&)</h4>
                <p>Returns 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise returns 0:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    1 0 1 1 (first number)
                  & 1 1 0 1 (second number)
                  -------
                    1 0 0 1 (result)
                </div>
                
                <h4>2. Bitwise OR (|)</h4>
                <p>Returns 1 if at least one bit is 1, otherwise returns 0:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    1 0 1 1 (first number)
                  | 1 1 0 1 (second number)
                  -------
                    1 1 1 1 (result)
                </div>
                
                <h4>3. Bitwise XOR (^) - Exclusive OR</h4>
                <p>Returns 1 if exactly one bit is 1 (bits are different), otherwise returns 0:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    1 0 1 1 (first number)
                  ^ 1 1 0 1 (second number)
                  -------
                    0 1 1 0 (result)
                </div>
                
                <h4>4. Bitwise NOT (~) - One's Complement</h4>
                <p>Flips each bit (1 becomes 0, and 0 becomes 1):</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                  ~ 1 0 1 1
                  -------
                    0 1 0 0
                </div>
                
                <h4>5. Shift Operations</h4>
                <p>Bit shifting moves bits to the left or right:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left, filling with 0s on the right</li>
                    <li>Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right, filling with 0s on the left (or copying the sign bit in signed numbers)</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="code-block">
                    1 0 1 1 << 1 = 0 1 1 0 (left shift by 1)
                    1 0 1 1 >> 1 = 0 1 0 1 (right shift by 1)
                </div>
                <p>Left shifting by n positions is equivalent to multiplying by 2^n, while right shifting is equivalent to dividing by 2^n (for unsigned numbers).</p>

                <h3>Applications in Digital Circuits</h3>
                <p>Binary arithmetic is fundamental to how digital circuits operate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adder Circuits:</strong> Digital adders, from half-adders to full-adders and multi-bit adders, perform binary addition in hardware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs):</strong> The core of processors, ALUs perform various arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Registers and Counters:</strong> These components store and manipulate binary values, often with increment or decrement operations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microcontroller Programming:</strong> When programming microcontrollers for robotics, we often use binary arithmetic for efficient bit manipulation, setting or clearing specific pins, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <div class="note-box">
                    <strong>Practical Example:</strong> When controlling multiple LEDs connected to a single port, we can use bitwise operations to turn specific LEDs on or off without affecting others:
                    <pre>
    // Turn on LED connected to bit 3 without affecting other bits
    PORTB |= 0b00001000;  // Set bit 3 using OR
    
    // Turn off LED connected to bit 3 without affecting other bits
    PORTB &= ~0b00001000;  // Clear bit 3 using AND with NOT
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h3>Practice Exercises</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the binary numbers 1101 and 1011</li>
                    <li>Subtract 1010 from 11001 using direct method and two's complement</li>
                    <li>Multiply 1101 by 101</li>
                    <li>Perform bitwise AND, OR, and XOR on 1100 and 1010</li>
                    <li>Shift 10110 left by 2 positions and right by 1 position</li>
                </ol>
