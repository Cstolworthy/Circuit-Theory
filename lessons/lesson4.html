            <section>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In this lesson, we'll explore the various components that make up electronic circuits. Understanding these fundamental building blocks is essential for designing and building effective robotic systems.</p>
                <p>We'll examine passive components like resistors and capacitors, as well as active components like transistors and integrated circuits.</p>

                <h3>Resistors</h3>
                <p>Resistors are passive two-terminal components that implement electrical resistance in a circuit. They limit current flow and divide voltage.</p>
                
                <h4>Resistor Characteristics</h4>
                <p>The primary characteristic of a resistor is its resistance value, measured in ohms (Ω). Resistors also have power ratings (measured in watts) that indicate how much power they can dissipate without being damaged.</p>
                
                <div class="latex-block">
                    $$V = IR$$
                    <p>Where:</p>
                    $$\begin{array}{l}
                    V = \text{Voltage across the resistor (volts)} \\
                    I = \text{Current through the resistor (amperes)} \\
                    R = \text{Resistance (ohms)}
                    \end{array}$$
                </div>
                
                <h4>Resistor Color Codes</h4>
                <p>Resistors use a standardized color-coding system to indicate their resistance value and tolerance. Learning to read these color bands is an essential skill for electronics work.</p>

                    <h5>Memory Tips for Resistor Color Codes</h5>
                    <p>To remember the color order, many electronics students use a mnemonic:</p>
                    <p><strong>"B</strong>ad <strong>B</strong>eer <strong>R</strong>ots <strong>O</strong>ur <strong>Y</strong>oung <strong>G</strong>uts <strong>B</strong>ut <strong>V</strong>odka <strong>G</strong>oes <strong>W</strong>ell"</p>
                    <p>This corresponds to: <strong>B</strong>lack, <strong>B</strong>rown, <strong>R</strong>ed, <strong>O</strong>range, <strong>Y</strong>ellow, <strong>G</strong>reen, <strong>B</strong>lue, <strong>V</strong>iolet, <strong>G</strong>rey, <strong>W</strong>hite</p>
                </div>

                <p>For a standard four-band resistor, simply read the first two color bands as digits, the third band as a multiplier (number of zeros to add), and the fourth band as the tolerance.</p>
                
                <p>Five-band and six-band resistors follow a similar pattern but include additional precision digits or temperature coefficient information.</p>
                
                <h4>Resistors in Circuits</h4>
                <p>Resistors serve multiple purposes in electronic circuits:</p>

                <h3>Inductors and Transformers</h3>
                <p>Inductors are passive two-terminal components that store energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through them. They typically consist of a coil of wire, sometimes wound around a core material.</p>
                
                <h4>Inductor Characteristics</h4>
                <p>The primary characteristic of an inductor is its inductance, measured in henries (H). When current through an inductor changes, it develops a voltage that opposes the change in current.</p>
                
                <div class="latex-block">
                    $$V = L \frac{dI}{dt}$$

                </div>
                
                <h4>Types of Inductors</h4>
                <p>Inductors come in various types based on their core material:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Air-core inductors:</strong> Use air as the core material, common in RF applications</li>
